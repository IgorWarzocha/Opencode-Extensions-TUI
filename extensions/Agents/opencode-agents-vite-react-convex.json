  "readme": "# Opencode Workflows\n\nA collection of Opencode-based command templates, global agent prompts, and\nworkflow patterns for building sophisticated command-driven projects.\n\n## Currently Included\n\n### Commands2Skills Template\n\nA universal command template with:\n- **Command Integration Pattern**: 4-part architecture for command-to-tool interfaces\n- **Template Structure**: Organized framework for command-based projects\n- **Documentation System**: Automated maintenance via specialized agents\n- **Model Compatibility**: Tested with GPT-5.1 series models\n- **Example Commands**: Repository exploration and mathematical calculation tools\n\nSee `Commands2Skills/README.md` for implementation details, architecture overviews,\nand usage guidance.\n\n### Agent Catalog\n\nAgents are organized into two collections under `Agents/`:\n\n- **Generic/** – Reusable global agents that belong in `~/.config/opencode/agent/`:\n  - **agent-architect** – Refines agents with research-backed prompts (best after running `opencode agent create`).\n  - **repo-navigator-creator** – Builds lean AGENTS.md navigation guides.\n  - **subagent-orchestrator** – Dispatches specialists and enforces scope isolation.\n  - **openspec-orchestrator** – Enforces strict OpenSpec formatting/validation and orchestrates subagents for executing OpenSpec proposals (requires [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) installed and `openspec init`).\n- **Vite-React-TS-Convex-Tailwind/** – Stack-specific experts for the modern Vite + React 19.2 + TS 5.9 + Tailwind 4.1 + Convex stack. Each agent references its matching documentation file (`CONVEX.md`, `REACT19.md`, `TAILWIND4.md`, `TS59.MD`) so it can cite authoritative answers on demand:\n  - **vite-react-convex-expert** – Master coordinator for the entire stack, orchestrating subagents.\n  - **convex-database-expert** – Schema/query/mutation/action specialist grounded in Convex docs.\n  - **react-19-master** – React 19.2 implementation reviewer focused on Server Components, Actions, and compiler rules.\n  - **tailwind-41-architect** – Tailwind CSS 4.1 designer that enforces the CSS-first workflow.\n  - **typescript-59-engineer** – Strict TS 5.9 engineer who guards erasable syntax and configuration hygiene.\n\nSee `Agents/README.md` for full tables, usage details, and the complete directory tree.\n\n### Commands Catalog\n\nThe `Commands/` directory provides shareable command files for Opencode users.\nCurrently available:\n- **`/howto`** (`Commands/.opencode/command/howto.md`): An `/init`-style command that\n  scans the cloned repository, searches for official documentation, and generates\n  an `AGENTS.md` focused on helping end users set up, operate, and troubleshoot\n  the software (not for development work). Run `/howto` right after cloning a repo\n  so your assistant knows how to install, run, and support that project.\n- **`/improve:run`** (`Commands/.opencode/command/improve:run.md`): Transforms any task into a production-ready prompt using official prompt engineering guides from OpenAI GPT-5.1/5.1-Codex, Anthropic Claude 4.5, and Google Gemini 3 Pro, then executes it immediately.\n- **`/improve:save`** (`Commands/.opencode/command/improve:save.md`): Same enhancement as `/improve:run` but saves the optimized prompt as a markdown file for review and refinement before execution.\n\n### Scripts Catalog\n\nThe `Scripts/` directory contains utilities that commands or agents can reuse.\n- **`perplexica-cli.js`** – Node-based CLI wrapper for Perplexica’s search API\n  that handles long-running requests (300s timeout), prints answers with sources,\n  and exposes focus modes (web, academic, Reddit, YouTube, Wolfram) via `--mode`\n  flags. Point it at your Perplexica instance (default `http://localhost:3000/api/search`). Best used with the `/perplexica-search` command.\n\n### @At Reference Files\n\nUse everything inside `At/` as prefix instructions during development sessions:\n- **`@coding-ts`** (`At/CODING-TS.MD`): Universal engineering guidelines emphasizing DRY principles,\n  type safety, and clean architecture. Reference it in prompts (e.g., “Implement feature X following @coding-ts principles”) before starting any new feature or refactor so the LLM stays aligned. These reference files are meant for direct @ mentions in user instructions and are not invoked by subagents.\n\n### MCP Configurations\n\n- **Authenticated Chrome DevTools MCP** (`MCP configs/Authenticated Chrome Dev Tools MCP/`) – Enables Chrome DevTools MCP to work with authenticated browser sessions. Normally Chromium blocks Google account login in automated browsers, and concurrent sessions can interfere with existing Chrome processes, potentially closing background windows. This wrapper creates a temporary \"shadow profile\" that clones your cookies, sessions, and login data, allowing AI agents to access your logged-in context without disrupting your main browser.\n\n**⚠️ Security Warning**: This enables agentic AI to access all your browser's data including logged-in accounts, cookies, and session information. Use with extreme caution.\n\n### Other Opencode Projects\n\n- **Agent Swarm Demo** ([repo](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/opencode-agent-swarm-demo)) – Shows how to launch a multi-server\n  swarm where Claude Code handles background process management while OpenCode runs specialized agents.\n  The swarm orchestrator coordinates inter-agent communication across multiple OpenCode instances and\n  currently requires Claude Code because it relies on Claude’s background bash processes to spawn the servers.\n\n## Getting Started\n1. Clone this repository locally.\n2. Explore `Commands2Skills/` for command templates and tooling patterns.\n3. Install desired agents globally (`~/.config/opencode/agent/`) or copy them into\n   your project’s `.opencode/agent/` directory.\n4. Install [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) and run `openspec init` if you plan to\n   use the OpenSpec orchestrator or compatible workflows.\n\n## Additional Documentation\n- `Commands2Skills/README.md` – command architecture, tooling integration, and\n  usage instructions.\n- `Agents/README.md` – agent descriptions, guardrails, and setup guidance.\n\n## About\nThis repository provides tested Opencode command patterns, global agent prompts,\nand workflow templates that demonstrate best practices for creating maintainable,\nscalable command-based projects with external tool integration.\n",
